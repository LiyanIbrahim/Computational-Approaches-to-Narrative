For this week's inform assignment, I decided to loosely adapt the clock arena from The Hunger Games as inspiration for a space to use. I thought it would be interesting to see how inform could be a tool used to recreate space in which every area has an action specific to it but also have the relationship of the different sections be very relevant and important to “surviving the game”. </br>
Using inform was definitely challenging for me. I think writing this now after spending hours and hours on it made me realize that it actually isn’t as un-intuitive as I initially thought. I think the language heavily adapts “normal” human terminologies but I thought it was un-intuitive given normal “coding” terminologies/systems. </br>
I found it hard to use mainly because I’m not super aware of what and how inform uses already built in words so I ended up spending a bunch of time trying to make actions that are already embedded or spent a lot of time debugging stuff because of things like I did not know I would need to physically define moving the person from one room to another. </br>
Therefore, I only ended up making 3 rooms with basic objects or actions but multiple dying points across all three rooms. I do still want to continue to work on it regardless of the challenges but also mainly because I feel like I’m a lot more familiar with the way to works so it gets exponentially easier and faster to work on it.
