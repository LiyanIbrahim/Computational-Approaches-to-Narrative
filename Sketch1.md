For this sketch, I wanted to work with the idea that the way people write narratives and perceive narrative and stories is dependent on a variety of factors, expectations and assumptions even prior to knowing anything about what they are about to read. I was inspired by my experience with the game “Her Story”. When playing the game, what I deduced from the plot to who I thought the characters were and what I thought of them, was heavily informed by the sequence of videos that I watched. However, during my experience, one thing that stayed consistent and that I found intriguing was how when the game first loaded, the search bar was “Murder” and that alone heavily framed the story and experience for me, even before watching a single video. Therefore, even though the game was interactive and non-linear, I already formed assumptions on what it was going to be about.

My narrative generating system mimics the game Mad libs but on a website. But it also allows users to pick a genre to recreate what the predetermined “Murder” search created. Once the user picks the genre, they are taken to a separate page to fill out the words needed to complete the story. The story is made up of an introduction, climax and conclusion. However, in both of the genres, the stories generated do not adhere to the category itself. They are both a mix of each other.

I also wanted to randomize the story itself (each of these components (introduction, climax and conclusion) are randomized across the genres) every time the user plays but I had errors that I wasn’t able to resolve in time. I didn’t play around extensively with the format of the story itself, mainly because I was worried about the right level of randomization for getting a point across (how much can I truly randomize before it becomes just a random story generator).
