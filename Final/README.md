Project Title: Patterns of Love in the People of Diaspora </br>

Project Description: "Patterns of Love in People of Diaspora" is an interactive Twine narrative exploring themes of identity, diaspora, and the complexities of loving a homeland one has never visited. The narrative places the user in the protagonist's shoes, delving into the struggles and emotions of being Palestinian, born into exile both before and during the genocide. The story unfolds through poetry, journal entries, and subtle exposition, offering users an intimate glimpse into the protagonist's experiences.
</br></br>
Process/Why Twine: Earlier this semester, I aimed to adapt my undergraduate thesis project using Twine. Dissatisfied with the minimal impact of hyperlinks and webpages in the original project, I took inspiration from Twine games that offered a more immersive experience. For an earlier sketch in Febuary, I began to change the original project's text into a journal format within Twine. Later, I added a second journal entry from October 2023, contextualizing personal experiences amidst the genocide. This addition provided a compelling contrast and enriched the narrative.
</br></br>
Inspired by the simplicity and effectiveness of games like "False Friends," for my final project, I aimed to utilize Twine effectively. Minimal graphics and a focus on text were key, with hyperlinks serving various purposes:
</br></br>
1. Regular hyperlinks advancing the narrative.</br>
2. "Context" hyperlinks providing additional background on the protagonist.</br>
3. "Changing" links altering words to shift sentence meanings.</br>
4. "distract()" links directing users to poignant poetry capturing the diaspora experience.</br>
Additionally, I experimented with pacing using Twine's timer method, ensuring users experience crucial pages regardless of their chosen path. All paths eventually converge to the same final pages.</br>

Next Steps: Moving forward, I plan to expand the journal entries, prioritizing intentional additions that enrich the text and narrative coherence.
