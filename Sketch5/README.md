I went to a poetry event last week and it really made me think about how poetry challenges/complies with how we view narratives and stories.  I also incorporate a lot of poetry in the work I do and so I wanted to see how I can use computer generated narratives to play around with poetry. I wanted to use the tracey to regenerate stories through poetry. I am particularly interested in the output once I combine older poetry and newer works and mix poets and styles. </br?
I needed to keep one common factor so it doesn’t present as completely random (which could be fun but just not what I was aiming to do for this assignment). </br?
A lot of the poetry I consume I would say fall under two categories: Identity and Palestine and Longing, and then Love (of all kinds). 
I decided to self-select the poems to include. I don’t really know if that defeats the purpose of having them computer generated but it’s an idea I have wanted to explore for a while so I decided to do it for this assignment.
I also segmented each of the poems based on my interpretation of where the beginning, middle and end of each one is (not based on quantity but rather the story being told in each one). </br?
The poems: (colors indicate what is used as the beginning, middle or end) </br>
