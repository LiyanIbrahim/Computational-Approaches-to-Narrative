For this assignment, I decided to create a narrative experience in which the user loses their memory and is able to walk through 4 rooms to find out what happened to them. 
</br>
I honestly really did not enjoy using bitsy. I thought it was very limiting and almost annoying to use and I found it kind of tricky coming up with a narrative for its format, which is interesting because all the games/experiences that were linked in the syllabus I found very enjoyable and I understood why the bitsy format makes sense. But coming up with an idea just so that it takes this format was a little annoying. 
</br>
I also did not really enjoy the visual restrictions like why does every room only have one color palette. I think the use of variables was interesting and added depth to the story but I donâ€™t know what I was doing wrong that I could not get them to work. I was trying to track the number of recipes viewed by the user and to give them a visual count of it so they can track it down but the variable did not work and so nothing was really displayed. 
</br>
But given all these restrictions, I would say I managed to get a semi-successful bitsy game that is intuitively navigable and gets the story across.
